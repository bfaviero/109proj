# Abstract

The top hedge funds these days makes billions in return every year, and over the past 15 years, their returns have beaten the overall stock market, helping drive the boom. In our project built on iPython and with Python's Pandas module, we studied stock holdings across 8 relatively well-performing global macro hedge funds. We studied whether each fund's strategy is beta-heavy and what are metrics, be it of the overall market, of separate market sectors, or of the hedge fund industry, that affect the fund's portfolio composition. Based on our analysis, we detected a strong correlation between market performance and stocks holdings, as indicated by a large portion of S&P stocks that these funds retain. Through our delta analysis, we also noticed that funds’ holdings vary quite a bit with consumer confidence and the general market performance, but not so much with variation in prices of their stock holdings.

# Overview

There are 3 stages to our project. We first defined what our objectives are -- to find correlation between various performance metrics along with stock prices and funds’ portfolio composition. Then we collected data both programmatically and manually from various credited sources explained in detail in the next section. Then we leveraged a couple of machine learning techniques to decipher our data. Lastly, we drew some conclusions based on our visualization and numeric analysis both on a fund level and on a global macro hedge fund strategy level.
